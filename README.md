üî≠ I'm a frontend developer specializing in React and TypeScript, currently working remotely. I've worked professionally for 3 years, built web solutions for various businesses and am particularly enthusiastic about creating software that truly meets user needs.

üíª My tech stack includes HTML, CSS, Sass, Git, Cypress, Jest, Node/Express, Javascript, React, TypeScript, GraphQL, and I'm always eager to learn more.

üå± I'm passionate about continuous improvement, both personally and in the code I write. You'll always find me upskilling and pushing the boundaries of what I can achieve.

üé∏ In my downtime, you might find me experimenting with music production, playing guitar, or watching some Curb Your Enthusiasm.
